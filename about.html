      <p class="subhead">WHAT</p>
      <p class="body-text">I design visual communications that make small companies look big and big
companies reach bigger markets. I create branding and design systems that make
potential customers look your way. The goal is to capture your customersâ€™ attention,
show them who you are, and prove the unique value you offer.</p>
<p class="subhead">HOW</p>
<p class="body-text">Good graphic design requires a combination of left-brain analysis and right-brain
creativity; a curious mix of strategic problem solving and empathic insight. To reach
our audience, we have to know what they want and how they think, and then we can
show them that we have exactly what they need and more.</p>
<p class="subhead">ETHIC</p>
<p class="body-text">Your success is my highest priority. My goal is to work as an extended member of your
team to help you reach your market. I listen to what you need and, if you need it, I
help you to define your brand objectives and how to get there. I listen to your needs,
value your input, and strive to provide quick, responsive service.</p>
<p class="subhead">OWNER</p>
